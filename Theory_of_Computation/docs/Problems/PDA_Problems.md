# PDA State Diagram Problems - Extended from DFA Problems

Given Σ = {a,b}, create PDA state diagrams for the following languages.

## Basic Stack Operations
These problems introduce fundamental PDA concepts by extending simple DFA problems:

1. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | number of a's equals number of b's }
   - Extended from DFA Problem #4 (even number of a's)
   - Requires stack to keep track of balance

2. L = { ww^R | w ∈ {a,b}* }
   - Extended from DFA Problem #14 (same start and end symbol)
   - Palindrome recognition using stack

3. L = { a^n b^n | n ≥ 1 }
   - Extended from DFA Problem #11 (a followed by b)
   - Classic PDA problem with counting

## Nested Patterns
These problems handle nested structures that DFAs cannot process:

4. L = { a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 0 }
   - Extended from DFA Problem #13 (divisible by 3)
   - Multiple counter problem

5. L = { w ∈ {a,b}* | w contains equal number of 'ab' and 'ba' substrings }
   - Extended from DFA Problem #23 (even number of ab's)
   - Requires pattern matching with counting

6. L = { w ∈ {(,)}* | w has properly balanced parentheses }
   - Extended from DFA Problem #16 (no aa or bb)
   - Classic parentheses matching

## Pattern Counting with Memory
Extended versions of counting problems that require stack memory:

7. L = { w ∈ {a,b}* | |w|_a = 2|w|_b }
   - Extended from DFA Problem #8 (exactly two a's)
   - Ratio counting using stack

8. L = { w ∈ {a,b}* | w contains twice as many 'ab' as 'ba' }
   - Extended from DFA Problem #18 (exactly one ab)
   - Pattern ratio counting

9. L = { a^i b^j c^k | i,j,k ≥ 0 and i = j or j = k }
   - Extended from DFA Problem #28 (modular arithmetic)
   - Multiple condition counting

## Context Dependencies
Problems involving complex pattern relationships:

10. L = { w ∈ {a,b}* | w = xy where |x| = |y| and x ≠ y }
    - Extended from DFA Problem #21 (alternating)
    - Comparison of equal-length substrings

11. L = { w#w | w ∈ {a,b}* }
    - Extended from DFA Problem #27 (contains aa and bb)
    - String copying and comparison

12. L = { a^i b^j c^k | i,j,k ≥ 0 and i + j = k }
    - Extended from DFA Problem #17 (more a's than b's)
    - Sum relationship verification

## Suggested Approach Order:

1. Start with Basic Stack Operations (Problems 1-3)
   - These introduce fundamental PDA concepts
   - Focus on simple counting and matching

2. Move to Nested Patterns (Problems 4-6)
   - Introduces multiple counters
   - Deals with nested structures

3. Progress to Pattern Counting (Problems 7-9)
   - Combines counting with pattern recognition
   - Requires more complex stack operations

4. Finally tackle Context Dependencies (Problems 10-12)
   - Most complex problems
   - Requires sophisticated stack manipulation

## Key Concepts to Master:

1. Stack Operations:
   - Push/Pop mechanics
   - Stack symbols vs. input symbols
   - Empty stack acceptance

2. State Management:
   - Combining finite control with stack
   - Epsilon transitions
   - Multiple stack symbols

3. Design Techniques:
   - Counter implementation
   - Pattern matching with memory
   - String comparison strategies

4. Advanced Features:
   - Multiple counters
   - Nested structure handling
   - Complex pattern relationships

Note: These PDA problems demonstrate features that are impossible for DFAs to handle, specifically:
- Counting and comparing arbitrary numbers of symbols
- Matching nested patterns
- Comparing different parts of the input
- Maintaining unlimited memory of past inputs
