# DFA State Diagram Problems

Given Σ = {a,b}, create DFA state diagrams for the following languages:

1. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x starts with 'aa' }
2. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x ends with 'bb' }
3. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains 'aba' }
4. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x has even number of a's }
5. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x has odd number of b's }
6. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | length of x is even }
7. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x starts with 'a' and ends with 'b' }
8. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains exactly two a's }
9. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains at least two b's }
10. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x does not contain 'aa' }
11. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | every 'a' is followed by 'b' }
12. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains 'bab' }
13. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | number of a's is divisible by 3 }
14. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x starts and ends with the same symbol }
15. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x has at most two a's }
16. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains neither 'aa' nor 'bb' }
17. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x has more a's than b's }
18. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains exactly one 'ab' }
19. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | length of x is at least 3 }
20. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains 'aab' or 'abb' }
21. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x has alternating a's and b's }
22. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x has no more than three consecutive a's }
23. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains an even number of 'ab's }
24. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x does not end with 'ab' }
25. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | each 'b' is preceded by an 'a' }
26. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | length of x is at most 4 }
27. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains both 'aa' and 'bb' }
28. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | number of a's minus number of b's is divisible by 3 }
29. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x starts with 'a' and contains exactly two b's }
30. L = { x ∈ {a,b}* | x contains no three consecutive identical symbols }

Note: These problems cover various concepts including:
- Pattern matching
- Counting occurrences
- Modular arithmetic
- String properties
- Combinations of conditions
- Position-based conditions
- Length restrictions
