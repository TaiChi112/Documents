# Operating System: Full-Detail Knowledge Base

## Overview & Importance
An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, ensuring efficient, secure, and fair resource allocation. The OS is fundamental for usability, security, and performance of all computing devices, from servers to smartphones.

**Importance:**
- Enables user interaction with hardware
- Manages resources (CPU, memory, storage, I/O)
- Provides security and access control
- Supports multitasking and multi-user environments
- Foundation for application software

## Key Concepts
- **Process & Thread Management:** Creation, scheduling, and termination of processes and threads
- **Memory Management:** Allocation, protection, and swapping of memory
- **File System:** Organization, storage, and access of data
- **Device Management:** Control and communication with hardware devices
- **User Interface:** CLI, GUI, and APIs for user interaction
- **Security & Protection:** Authentication, authorization, and data integrity
- **Networking:** Communication between devices and over the Internet
- **System Calls:** Interface for user programs to request OS services
- **Virtualization:** Abstraction of hardware for multiple environments
- **Multitasking & Multiprocessing:** Running multiple tasks or processes concurrently

**Exploration Questions:**

## Theories / Models
- **Process Scheduling Algorithms:** FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling
- **Memory Management Models:** Paging, Segmentation, Virtual Memory
- **File System Models:** FAT, NTFS, ext4, HFS+
- **Synchronization Models:** Semaphores, Mutexes, Monitors
- **Deadlock Theories:** Coffman conditions, Deadlock prevention/avoidance/detection
- **Security Models:** Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Example: Round Robin Scheduling (Pseudo-code)**
```pseudo
while (processes in ready queue):
    run process for time quantum
    if process not finished:
        move to end of queue
```

**Mermaid Diagram: Process State Transition**

    [*] --> New
    New --> Ready
    Ready --> Running
    Running --> Waiting
    Waiting --> Ready
    Running --> Terminated
    Ready --> Running
```

**Exploration Questions:**
- How does paging differ from segmentation?
- What are the trade-offs of different scheduling algorithms?

## Processes / Workflows
1. **Process Lifecycle:**
   - New → Ready → Running → Waiting → Terminated
2. **Memory Allocation:**
   - Request memory → Allocate (paging/segmentation) → Access → Release
3. **File Access:**
   - Open file → Read/Write → Close file
4. **Device I/O:**
   - Request I/O → OS schedules → Device driver executes → Completion interrupt
5. **User Authentication:**
   - User login → Credential verification → Access granted/denied

**Exploration Questions:**
- What happens when a process requests more memory than available?
- How does the OS handle device interrupts?
