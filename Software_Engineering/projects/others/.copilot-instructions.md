# Project Context
This project aims to build an MVP web app for personalized course registration recommendations for university students.

## Core Idea
Students have diverse constraints (work, travel, prior knowledge, age). The system must collect their profiles and generate a recommended course plan that fits their situation.

## Tech Stack
- Runtime: Bun
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript
- Backend: Elysia + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma
- Infra: Docker + Docker Compose

## Dev Guidelines
- Prioritize backend API & DB logic first.
- Use rule-based recommendation in MVP.
- Keep frontend minimal for testing.
- All services must run together via Docker Compose.

## API Must Include
- /auth/register
- /auth/login
- /profile/upsert
- /recommendations/generate
- /stats/overview

## Success Criteria
- JWT auth works
- Recommendation includes explanations
- No schedule conflicts
- Seed DB with demo data
