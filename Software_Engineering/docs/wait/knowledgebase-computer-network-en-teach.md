# Computer Network: Comprehensive Knowledge Base

## Overview
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, networking hardware) that communicate and share resources using standardized protocols. Networks enable data exchange, resource sharing, and distributed computing, forming the backbone of modern digital communication and the Internet.

**Importance:**
- Facilitates communication (email, messaging, VoIP)
- Enables resource sharing (files, printers, storage)
- Supports distributed applications and cloud computing
- Forms the infrastructure for the Internet and enterprise systems

## Key Concepts
- **Node & Host:** Any device connected to a network (e.g., computer, printer, router)
- **Network Topology:** The physical/logical arrangement of network devices (e.g., star, bus, ring, mesh)
- **Protocol:** Set of rules for data communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP)
- **IP Address:** Unique identifier for a device on a network
- **MAC Address:** Hardware address assigned to network interfaces
- **Packet Switching:** Data is split into packets for efficient transmission
- **Bandwidth & Latency:** Measures of network speed and delay
- **Firewall & Security:** Mechanisms to protect network resources
- **Client-Server & Peer-to-Peer:** Models for networked application architecture

---

## Subfields / Categories
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small geographic area (office, home)
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Large geographic area (cities, countries)
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** City-wide networks
- **Wireless Networks:** Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular
- **Internet & Intranet:** Global public network vs. private internal network
- **Network Security:** Protecting data and resources
- **Network Management:** Monitoring, configuring, and maintaining networks

---

## Principles and Theories
- **OSI Model:** 7-layer reference model (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application)
- **TCP/IP Model:** 4-layer practical model (Link, Internet, Transport, Application)
- **Routing Algorithms:** Shortest path (Dijkstra), distance vector, link state
- **Error Detection/Correction:** Parity, CRC, Hamming code
- **Congestion Control:** TCP windowing, flow control
- **Addressing & Subnetting:** IP classes, subnet masks, CIDR

---

## Processes / Workflows
1. **Data Transmission (TCP/IP):**
   - Application creates data
   - Data is segmented (Transport layer)
   - Packets are addressed (Network layer)
   - Frames are created (Data Link layer)
   - Bits are transmitted (Physical layer)
2. **Network Setup:**
   - Device configuration (IP, subnet, gateway)
   - Physical connection (cables, Wi-Fi)
   - Protocol negotiation (DHCP, ARP)
3. **Routing:**
   - Router receives packet
   - Looks up routing table
   - Forwards packet to next hop

## Applications / Examples
- **Email & Web Browsing:** SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP/HTTPS
- **File Sharing:** FTP, SMB, NFS
- **Remote Access:** SSH, VPN
- **VoIP & Video Conferencing:** SIP, RTP, WebRTC
- **IoT Networks:** Smart home devices, sensors
