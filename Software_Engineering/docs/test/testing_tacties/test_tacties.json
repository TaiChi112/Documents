    "title": "Testing Methods Applicable at the Class Level",
    "definition": "Class-level testing methods focus on verifying the functionality and correctness of individual classes as units, examining their attributes, methods, encapsulation, and adherence to their contracts and specifications.",
    "objective": "To verify that each class correctly implements its intended behavior, maintains its invariants, properly handles invalid inputs, and functions correctly as a standalone unit before integration with other components.",
    "importance": "Classes are the fundamental building blocks in object-oriented systems. Thorough class-level testing ensures that each building block is solid before integration, reducing the likelihood of complex bugs in the assembled system and providing a foundation for higher-level tests.",
    "techniques": [
      "Random Testing (testing with randomly generated inputs)",
      "Partition Testing (testing with inputs from different equivalence classes)",
      "State-Based Testing (verifying correct state transitions within objects)",

      "Scenario Testing (testing common usage scenarios)",
      "Method Testing (testing each method with various inputs)"
    ],
    "advantages": [
      "Isolates defects to specific classes early in development",
      "Provides a strong foundation for integration testing",
      "Simplifies debugging by narrowing the scope of potential issues",
      "Makes refactoring safer through regression tests",
      "Encourages better class design through testability requirements",
      "Serves as documentation of class behavior"
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
      "May not catch integration issues between classes",
      "Can require extensive test fixtures and setup",
      "May need mock objects for classes with dependencies",
      "Can be time-consuming for classes with many methods",
      "May encourage overly granular tests that are fragile to changes"
    ],
    "example": "For a BankAccount class: Class-level testing would verify that (1) new accounts are created with the correct initial balance, (2) deposit and withdrawal methods correctly update the balance, (3) withdrawals exceeding available funds are handled appropriately, (4) interest calculations work correctly, and (5) account state cannot be corrupted through invalid operations.",

    "definition": "Inter-class test case design focuses on verifying the correct interactions, communications, and collaborations between multiple classes within a system, examining how objects exchange messages, share data, and coordinate behavior.",
    "objective": "To detect defects that arise from the interactions between classes, ensure that class collaborations function correctly, verify that integrated components satisfy system requirements, and validate that contracts between classes are properly fulfilled.",
    "importance": "Most object-oriented systems involve complex networks of collaborating objects. While individual classes may work correctly in isolation, errors often occur in their interactions. Inter-class testing bridges the gap between unit and system testing, catching integration issues early.",
