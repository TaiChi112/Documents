## Agents in AI
- for example

## Key Feature of AI Agents
- Autonomous
- Goal-driven
- Perceptive
- Adaptable
- Collaborative

## How do AI Agents Work?
1. **Person**
2. **Memory**
   - Short-term memory
   - Long-term memory
   - Episodic memory
   - Consensus memory
3. **Tools**
4. **Model**

## Architecture of AI Agents
- Profiling Module
- Memory Module
- Planning Module
- Action Module

## AI Agent Classification
- Reactive Agents
- Proactive Agents
- Single-Agent Systems
- Multi-Agent Systems
- Rational Agents

## Types of Agents
1. **Simple Reflex Agents**
    - Key Feature
      - No memory of past state
      - No model of how the world works
      - Purely reactive behavior
      - Function best fully observable environments
2. **Model-Based Reflex Agents**
   - Key Feature
     - Track the world's state over time
     - Infer unobservable aspects of current states
     - Function effectively in partially observable environments
     - Still primarily reactive, but with contextual awareness
3. **Goal-Based Agents**
   - Key Feature
     - Employ search and planning mechanisms
     - Evaluate actions base on their contribution toward goal achievement
     - Consider future states and outcomes
     - May explore multiple possible routes to a goal
4. **Utility-Based Agents**
   - Key Feature
     - Balance multiple, sometimes conflicting objectives
     - Handle probabilistic and uncertain environments
     - Evaluate actions base on expected utility
     - Make rational decisions under constraints
5. **Learning Agents**
   - Key Feature
     - Adapt to changing environments
     - Improve performance with experience
     - Contain both a performance element and a learning element
     - Generate new knowledge rather than simply applying existing rules
6. **Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Key Feature
     - Agents act independently and control their own state
     - Agents align, collaborate or compete to reach goals
     - The system remains resilient if individual agents fail
     - Decisions are distributed; there's no single controller
7. **Hierarchical Agents**
    - Key Feature
      - Division of responsibilities across multiple layers or levels
      - Abstract decision-making at higher levels
      - Detailed execution at lower levels
      - Simplified information flow (higher levels receive summarized data)
