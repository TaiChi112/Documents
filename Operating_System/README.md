## WSL
The error code 
**Wsl/Service/CreateInstance/CreateVm/HCS/HCS_E_SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE** indicates that a required Windows feature for running WSL 2 virtual machines is not installed or properly configured. This often relates to the underlying virtualization components that WSL 2 relies on.

**Common causes and solutions**:
- **Virtual Machine Platform or Windows Hypervisor Platform not enabled**:

**WSL 2 requires these features to be enabled.**
- Open the Start menu, search for "Turn Windows features on or off" and open it.
- Ensure that "Virtual Machine Platform" and "Windows Hypervisor Platform" are checked.
- Click "OK" and restart your computer if prompted.
- Hardware virtualization not enabled in BIOS/UEFI:

Your computer's BIOS or UEFI settings must have hardware virtualization (e.g., Intel VT-x or AMD-V) enabled for WSL 2 to function.

- Access your computer's BIOS/UEFI settings during startup (usually by pressing a key like Del, F2, F10, or F12).
- Locate and enable the virtualization technology setting. The exact name varies by manufacturer.
- Save changes and exit BIOS/UEFI.

**Corrupted WSL installation or configuration.**
If the above steps do not resolve the issue, a reinstallation or reset of WSL might be necessary. Open PowerShell as Administrator and Run the following commands.

```sh
wsl --shutdown
wsl --unregister <YourDistroName> # Replace with your WSL distribution name, e.g., Ubuntu
wsl --uninstall
wsl --install --no-distribution
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

- Restart your computer.
- Then, install your desired distribution:

```sh
wsl --install -d <YourDistroName> # e.g., wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

**Conflicting virtualization software.**
Other virtualization software (like VMware Workstation or VirtualBox) can sometimes conflict with WSL 2's use of Hyper-V.
- Consider temporarily disabling or uninstalling other virtualization software if you suspect a conflict.
- Ensure that Hyper-V is set to launch automatically if you are using it:

```sh
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
```

Then, restart your computer. Core Isolation - Memory Integrity.

In some cases, disabling Core Isolation's Memory Integrity feature in Windows Security has resolved this error.
- Open Windows Security > Device Security > Core Isolation details.
- Turn off "Memory integrity" if it is enabled.
- Restart your computer.

After attempting these solutions, try running your WSL distribution again.
