# Planning Phase
- Generate the "Planning" phase documentation for a Web Calculator MVP. The project's goal is to create a functional, single-page web calculator. The document should outline the project scope, business objectives, and a high-level technology stack. The technology stack should include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Focus on creating clear, concise documentation suitable for a development team.

# Analysis Phase
- Create the "Analysis" phase documentation for the Web Calculator MVP. The document should detail the user requirements and functional requirements. For the user requirements, provide two user stories that capture the core functionalities. For the functional requirements, list and describe the key functions, such as basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and a clear button.

# Design Phase
- Produce the "Design" phase documentation for the Web Calculator MVP. The document should contain a description of the high-level system architecture and a breakdown of the UI/UX design. The architecture should be a simple, client-side-only model. The UI/UX design section should describe the layout, including the display area and button grid, along with the visual and interactive elements.
