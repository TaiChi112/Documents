# 10 Popular Software Architectures:

- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
    - Focuses on decoupling the core logic from external systems.

- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
    - Separates an application into Model, View, and Controller layers.

- Microservices Architecture
    - Divides the application into small, loosely coupled services.

- Layered (N-Tier) Architecture
    - Organizes code into layers like Presentation, Business, Data, etc.

- Event-Driven Architecture
    - Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled components.

- Serverless Architecture
    - Runs applications in stateless containers managed by cloud providers.

- Monolithic Architecture
    - A single unified application built as one unit.

- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
    - Similar to Microservices but often involves heavier, centralized integration.

- Pipeline Architecture
    - Processes data through a series of stages or filters.

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
    - Focuses on the business domain and its logic, dividing the system by bounded contexts.

# 8 Architectures to Explore:

- Clean Architecture
    - Prioritizes separation of concerns and maintainability.

- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
    - Splits read and write operations for scalability and performance.

- Event Sourcing
    - Stores changes as a sequence of events instead of the current state.

- Onion Architecture
    - Emphasizes dependency inversion with concentric layers.

- Reactive Architecture
    - Designed for real-time systems, focusing on responsiveness and resilience.

- Space-Based Architecture
    - Handles high scalability using in-memory data grids and distributed processing.

- Peer-to-Peer Architecture
    - Enables decentralized systems where nodes act as both clients and servers.

- Micro-frontend Architecture
    - Extends Microservices principles to frontend development for modular UI.
