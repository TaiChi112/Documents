## introduction and inteligent agents

- introduction to ai
  - intelligent agents
    - agent and environment
      - the structure of agent

### AGI
  - the AGI concept is that it can learn to oaccomplish any intelligent task that human begins or animals can perform
    - abstract thinking
    - transfer learning
    - following common sense in making desision
    - comprehension of cause effect
    - backgroun knowledge
    - creativness
  - e.q. AGI
    - virtual assistants
    - operating systems
    - household robots
  - e.q. generate 2-hour movies
    - avatars
    - video ideas
    - scripts
    - narration
    - content strategies
  - e.q. photorealistic virtual worlds
    - contact lens (VR)
    - photo and video
    - personalized game design
  - e.q. Humans are able to merge with ai
    - hybrid ai (cloud resoureces)
    - microchip implants
  - humans are communicating with each other telepathically
  - AIs are writing better software than most software developers

### what is AI? why do we need it?
    - the more intelligent of machine, the less work for human

### AI vs Maching Learning vs Deep Learning
    - AI is a program that can sense, reason, act, and adapt
    - ML it is Algorithms whose performance improve as they are expose to more data over time
    - DL is a subset of ML in which multi-layered neural networks learn from vast amounts of data

### Traditional vs. ML
    - traditional software development
      - the input and the algorithm is known, and you write a function to produce an output
        - input data
        - apply logic to it
        - which produces a result 
    - Machine learning
      - you know the input and the output, but you don't know the algorithm that creates the output given the input
        - take pairs of input and output data
        - figure out the algorithm
    - e.q. traditinal software development
      - def function (C) F = C * 1.8 + 32 return F
      - input is C
      - produce F = C * 1.8 + 31 
      - output is F
    - e.q. Machine learning
    - input 0,8,15,22 -> def function(C)
    - algorithm -> ?(something predictive)
    - outout 32, 46, 59, 72 

    - C = [0, 8, 15, 22]  F = [32, 46, 59, 72] {Machine Learning} RULE F = C * 1.8 + 32

      - feature description

### intelligent agent
  - An AI program is called "intelligent agent"
    - perception/action cycle
