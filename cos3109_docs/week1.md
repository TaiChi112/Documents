## introduction and inteligent agents

- introduction to ai
  - intelligent agents
    - agent and environment
      - the structure of agent

### AGI
    - abstract thinking
    - transfer learning
    - following common sense in making desision
    - comprehension of cause effect
    - backgroun knowledge
    - creativness
  - e.q. AGI
    - virtual assistants
    - operating systems
    - household robots
  - e.q. generate 2-hour movies
    - avatars
    - video ideas
    - scripts
    - narration
    - content strategies
  - e.q. photorealistic virtual worlds
    - contact lens (VR)
    - photo and video
    - personalized game design
  - e.q. Humans are able to merge with ai
    - hybrid ai (cloud resoureces)
    - microchip implants
  - humans are communicating with each other telepathically
  - AIs are writing better software than most software developers

### what is AI? why do we need it?
    - the more intelligent of machine, the less work for human

### AI vs Maching Learning vs Deep Learning
    - AI is a program that can sense, reason, act, and adapt
    - ML it is Algorithms whose performance improve as they are expose to more data over time
    - DL is a subset of ML in which multi-layered neural networks learn from vast amounts of data

### Traditional vs. ML
    - traditional software development
      - the input and the algorithm is known, and you write a function to produce an output
        - input data
        - apply logic to it
        - which produces a result 
    - Machine learning
      - you know the input and the output, but you don't know the algorithm that creates the output given the input
        - take pairs of input and output data
        - figure out the algorithm
